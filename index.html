            <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
            <h3>What we collect</h3>
            <p>When you use Poke Helper, we collect basic information such as your Discord username and Discord ID to personalize features and enhance user experience. Additionally, server-specific data like channel information and server ID is collected to improve the bot's functionality.</p>
            <h3>How is the information used?</h3>
            <p>We utilize collected data to refine Poke Helper's features, enhance user interaction, and ensure legal compliance. Personalized features are tailored based on Discord username and ID, while interactions help us improve accuracy and troubleshoot bugs. Legal requirements are adhered to, with data shared with third parties only when mandated by law.</p>
            <h3>Who has access to the information?</h3>
            <p>The developer team indirectly accesses information via the Discord API for bot functionality. Third-party access is limited primarily to Discord, assisting in bot operation. Data sharing with third parties occurs only when legally obligated, such as in response to subpoenas or court orders.</p> 
            <h3>Your choices about the information.</h3>
            <p>Upon adding Poke Helper to your server, you consent to data collection for functionality. However, you retain the right to request access to or deletion of your data. Deletion requests trigger removal of custom settings, server-related data, and direct message history with the bot.</p> 
            <h3>Changes to this privacy policy.</h3>
            <p>We reserve the right to update this privacy policy periodically.</p>
